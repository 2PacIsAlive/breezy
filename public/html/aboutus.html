			What is BreezyTalk?
			</h1>
				BreezyTalk is a global communication site created at HackCU 2016 for the purpose of allowing ideas to flow freely, despite language or cultural
			barriers. The BreezyTalk team developed it with the intent of allowing people from all different places, who speak all different langauges, with 
			all different opinions, to be able to discuss just about anything. It was our goal to create a place where people could freeley discuss their opinions
			with random people, people with different opinions, or people from different parts of the world; we wanted to create an environment for 100% free speech.
